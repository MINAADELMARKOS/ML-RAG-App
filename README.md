# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system combines information retrieval with natural language generation. This system enhances the quality and factuality of generated responses by retrieving relevant context from external data sources before generating answers.

## 🧠 Overview

This RAG system architecture consists of:
- **Retriever**: Finds the most relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base.
- **Generator**: Generates human-like answers using a language model, guided by the retrieved documents.

Use cases include:
- Question answering
- Chatbots with knowledge bases
- Context-aware content generation
- Legal, healthcare, and enterprise search solutions

## ⚙️ Components

- **Document Store**: Stores the indexed documents (e.g., FAISS, Elasticsearch, Weaviate)
- **Embedding Model**: Converts text into vector representations (e.g., `sentence-transformers`, `OpenAI`, `Cohere`)
- **Retriever**: Retrieves top-k similar documents based on query embeddings
- **Generator**: Language model for answer generation (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers)
